# Journey in Tech

I'm a data science candidate with a Master's degree in progress and a strong foundation in computer science. My expertise lies in areas of 
Machine Learning to build and deploy predictive models, Data Analysis to extract insights and infer conclusions, and Software Development to design and develop applications. Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/admissions/Graduate-Admissions-Data-Science#2) and I obtained my Bachelor's in Computer Science from [SSN College of Engineering](https://www.ssn.edu.in/college-of-engineering/computer-science-and-engineering-department-ssn-institutions/).

In addition to that, I'm interested in sports and I exercise regularly. I love reading books and I listen to music a lot. It helps me have a peaceful time. I tend to keep my mental and physical health as balanced as possible. I consider myself a person who is accountable, progressive, and committed to continuous improvement.
